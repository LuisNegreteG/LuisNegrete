## About Me

I am a highly motivated and technically skilled data professional with extensive experience in data engineering, business intelligence, automation, and data analytics. Over the years, I have contributed to the design and implementation of scalable data pipelines, dynamic dashboards, and predictive analytical models that support data-driven decision-making across various industries.

Proficient in Python, SQL, data visualization tools (Power BI, Tableau and QlikSense), and cloud technologies like AWS and Azure, I have successfully automated workflows and improved data accessibility and quality, ensuring reliable insights for business units.

Currently pursuing a Master of Data Analytics in Canada, I am expanding my expertise into data science and predictive modeling, eager to leverage machine learning techniques to solve complex business problems while improving and consolidating my expertise in this amazing field.

Bilingual in English and Spanish, with strong communication skills and experience working in collaborative, remote environments, I seek opportunities where I can contribute technically while continuing to grow as a data scientist and analytics professional.
